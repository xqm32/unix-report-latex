  abstract   = {Faster cutting plane algorithms with accelerated line search are proposed to solve linear SVM.It proposes a novel linear-time line search solver while the existing strategy spends O(mlogm) time.An optimized explicit piecewise linear function finding algorithm for multiclass linear SVM is derived.It can be proved to reduce the total SVM training time.Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Cutting plane algorithm (CPA) is a generalization of iterative first-order gradient method, in which the objective function is approximated successively by supporting hyperplanes. CPA has been tailored to solve regularized loss minimization in machine learning by exploiting the regularization structure. In particular, for linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) embedding a line search procedure effectively remedies the fluctuations of function value and speeds up the convergence in practical issue. However, the existing line search strategy based on sorting algorithm takes O(mlogm) time. In this paper, we propose a more effective line search solver which spends only linear time. It can be extended to multiclass SVM in which an optimized explicit piecewise linear function finding algorithm is prearranged. The total SVM training time is proved to reduce theoretically and experiments consistently confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract   = {We have developed an optimized cutting plane algorithm (OCA) for solving large-scale risk minimization problems. We prove that the number of iterations OCA requires to converge to a ε precise solution is approximately linear in the sample size. We also derive OCAS, an OCA-based linear binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) solver, and OCAM, a linear multi-class SVM solver. In an extensive empirical evaluation we show that OCAS outperforms current state-of-the-art SVM solvers like SVMlight, SVMperf and BMRM, achieving speedup factor more than 1,200 over SVMlight on some data sets and speedup factor of 29 over SVMperf, while obtaining the same precise support vector solution. OCAS, even in the early optimization steps, often shows faster convergence than the currently prevailing approximative methods in this domain, SGD and Pegasos. In addition, our proposed linear multi-class SVM solver, OCAM, achieves speedups of factor of up to 10 compared to SVMmulti-class. Finally, we use OCAS and OCAM in two real-world applications, the problem of human acceptor splice site detection and malware detection. Effectively parallelizing OCAS, we achieve state-of-the-art results on an acceptor splice site recognition problem only by being able to learn from all the available 50 million examples in a 12-million-dimensional feature space.
